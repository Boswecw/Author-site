          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">My Journey</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
            My path to writing fantasy wasn't traditional, but it's been authentic. I started my career 
            serving in the U.S. Navy, where I learned discipline, leadership, and the importance of 
            brotherhood under pressure. Those early years taught me about courage—not the absence of fear, 
            but acting despite it.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
            After my naval service, I spent 16 years as a wildland firefighter, battling some of the 
            most dangerous fires across the American West. Standing before walls of flame that tower 
            hundreds of feet high, working alongside crews who become family—these experiences gave me 
            intimate knowledge of how people respond when everything is on the line.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
            Now, as a novelist, I channel those real-world experiences into fantasy realms where courage 
            matters, where brotherhood runs deeper than blood, and where the elements themselves become 
            both weapon and adversary. My military background brings tactical precision to battle scenes, 
            while my firefighting years provide authentic insight into working with dangerous elemental forces.

            <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Service Years</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">I proudly served in the United States Navy from 1993 to 1995, beginning my tour aboard the USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70), where I was part of Operation Desert Shield during a pivotal time in American military history. My service later took me beneath the waves on the USS Albuquerque (SSN-706), a Los Angeles-class fast-attack submarine, where discipline, teamwork, and precision were essential every single day. These experiences, both on the vast decks of a carrier and in the silent depths of a submarine, instilled in me resilience, adaptability, and a deep respect for service—qualities that continue to shape my life and my writing today.</p>

            <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Firefighting Career</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">After my naval service, I dedicated the next 16 years to battling wildfires, managing forests, and restoring wildlife habitat across the American West and heartland. From February 2003 to February 2009, I served with the Kentucky Division of Forestry as a Forest Ranger Technician III, where I worked on the front lines of wildfire suppression, forest management, and habitat improvement. I then joined the Fort Campbell Forestry Division as a Forestry Technician from 2009 to 2010, continuing hands-on fire management, resource stewardship, and wildlife habitat projects. From 2010 until March 2020, I served with the Hoosier National Forest as a Forestry Technician, where I helped protect and sustain public lands through fire prevention, habitat management, and conservation. These years in forestry taught me endurance, leadership under pressure, and a deep respect for the natural world—experiences that continue to influence my work and writing today.</p>

            <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Writing Focus</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Drawing on the discipline and adaptability of my years as a U.S. Navy Petty Officer, I craft worlds where strategy and survival matter as much as sorcery. My stories blend the grit of service at sea with the wonder of high fantasy, where battles are waged with both steel and the primal forces of storm, fire, and shadow. This is epic fantasy shaped by naval precision and elemental magic.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Why I Write Fantasy</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          Fantasy allows me to explore the deepest truths about courage, sacrifice, and loyalty 
          in ways that purely realistic fiction cannot. When I write about a character facing 
          down a dragon, I'm really writing about every firefighter who has stood before an 
          impossible blaze. When I describe the bond between warriors in my novels, I'm drawing 
          from the unbreakable connections formed in foxholes and fire camps.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          The fantasy genre gives me the freedom to magnify these human experiences—to make 
          the stakes as high as they feel in real life when lives hang in the balance. Magic 
          systems in my books often mirror the unpredictable nature of fire, while military 
          formations and tactics ground the action in reality.
