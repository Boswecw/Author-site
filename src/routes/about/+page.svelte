          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
            My path to writing fantasy wasn't traditional, but it's been authentic. I started my career 
            serving in the U.S. Navy, where I learned discipline, leadership, and the importance of 
            brotherhood under pressure. Those early years taught me about courage—not the absence of fear, 
            but acting despite it.
          </p>
          
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
            After my naval service, I spent 16 years as a wildland firefighter, battling some of the 
            most dangerous fires across the American West. Standing before walls of flame that tower 
            hundreds of feet high, working alongside crews who become family—these experiences gave me 
            intimate knowledge of how people respond when everything is on the line.
          </p>
          
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
            Now, as a novelist, I channel those real-world experiences into fantasy realms where courage 
            matters, where brotherhood runs deeper than blood, and where the elements themselves become 
            both weapon and adversary. My military background brings tactical precision to battle scenes, 
            while my firefighting years provide authentic insight into working with dangerous elemental forces.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Why I Write Fantasy</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          Fantasy allows me to explore the deepest truths about courage, sacrifice, and loyalty 
          in ways that purely realistic fiction cannot. When I write about a character facing 
          down a dragon, I'm really writing about every firefighter who has stood before an 
          impossible blaze. When I describe the bond between warriors in my novels, I'm drawing 
          from the unbreakable connections formed in foxholes and fire camps.
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          The fantasy genre gives me the freedom to magnify these human experiences—to make 
          the stakes as high as they feel in real life when lives hang in the balance. Magic 
          systems in my books often mirror the unpredictable nature of fire, while military 
          formations and tactics ground the action in reality.
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          Every battle scene is informed by real strategy, every moment of brotherhood echoes 
          actual bonds forged in crisis, and every character's courage is tested in ways that 
          mirror the impossible choices real heroes make every day.
